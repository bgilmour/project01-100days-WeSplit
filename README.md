# WeSplit

This is my solution to the WeSplit project (project 1) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by
Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). It includes some reworking of the step-by-step solution created when following the tutorial
to accommodate the three additional challenges.
